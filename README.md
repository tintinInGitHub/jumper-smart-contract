<h2> ‚ú® The problem Jumper X Axelar solves</h2>

In a rapidly expanding blockchain ecosystem, different blockchain networks host unique NFT ecosystems. However, these ecosystems are often isolated, limiting the potential for collaboration and growth. The challenge is to create a cross-chain NFT evolution platform that allows NFTs to bridge across multiple chains, collect bridge points, and evolve over time to unlock rewards.

1.Programmability: Dynamic NFTs are designed with smart contract functionality that allows them to respond to certain conditions, triggers, or inputs. This programmability enables them to exhibit changing behaviors or appearances.

2.Evolution and Interactivity: Dynamic NFTs can evolve over time based on interactions, external data, or specific events. This could involve changing visuals, attributes, or even incorporating external data feeds.

3.Utility: Dynamic NFTs can serve practical purposes beyond collectibles and art. For instance, they can represent in-game assets that improve over time, virtual real estate with changing features, or membership tokens with varying privileges.

4.Use Cases of NFTs: Dynamic NFTs find applications in gaming, virtual worlds, decentralized applications (dApps), and platforms where the value of the NFT is tied to its evolving nature and utility.

5.Cross-Chain Gaming Assets:
Players can own NFTs representing characters, weapons, skins, and other in-game assets. These NFTs can originate from different blockchains, allowing players to interact with their assets across various gaming ecosystems

<h2>‚òîÔ∏è Challenges we ran into</h2>

1.Unfamiliar Technology Stack:Since it's our first time that we try to build the Web3 Project,the learning curve is kinda steep.

2.Integration Issues:Integrating various decentralized technologies is tricky. We have to test each function to confirm they're working.

3.Time Management:Axelathon is time-sensitive event, and managing the time efficiently can be difficult, especially when we're juggling learning new technologies and building a functional product. We have to create a timeline and stick to it.

4.NFT Business Development : Learning NFT business development can be challenging due to the rapidly evolving landscape, requiring a grasp of both blockchain technology and market trends. Developing effective monetization strategies while standing out in a competitive field and navigating legal complexities adds to the complexity.

5.NFT Community Building : Building an NFT community project can be challenging as it involves fostering engagement among diverse participants, creating shared value, and maintaining active participation. Overcoming initial skepticism, ensuring consistent communication, and sustaining community interest amidst competing projects and information can pose difficulties.
